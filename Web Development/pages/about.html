					<h3>What We Do</h3>
					<p>At Everybody's closet, our mission is to provide second hand clothing at a discounted price. We believe that every person has a right to cool and unique clothing.
					We strive to only accept the clothing we would want to wear. All clothing comes from donations from the community. Our locations can be found in smaller towns that don't have a consignment store available.
					Not only do we provide clothes, we also have sporting goods. We have games for children, puzzles, and books. We are here to provide a service some places don't have, but desperatly need.</p>
